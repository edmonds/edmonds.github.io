<p>I recently installed new hardware in my primary computer running Debian
unstable. The disk used for the <code>/</code> and <code>/home</code> filesystem was replaced with an
<a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/solid-state-drives/solid-state-drives-750-series.html">Intel SSD 750 series</a> NVM Express card. The graphics card was replaced by an
<a href="http://www.amd.com/en-us/products/graphics/workstation/firepro-3d/4100">AMD FirePro W4100</a> card, and two <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;sku=210-ADOF">Dell P2715Q</a> monitors were installed.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/solid-state-drives/solid-state-drives-750-series.html">Intel SSD 750 series</a> NVM Express card</h3>
<p>This is an 800 GB SSD on a PCI-Express x4 card (model number <code>SSDPEDMW800G4X1</code>)
using the relatively new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVM_Express">NVM Express</a> interface, which appears as a
<code>/dev/nvme*</code> device. The stretch alpha 4 Debian installer was able to detect and
install onto this device, but <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/grub-installer">grub-installer</a> 1.127 on the installer media was
unable to install the boot loader. This was due to a bug recently fixed in
1.128:</p>
<pre><code class="boxed">grub-installer (1.128) unstable; urgency=high

<p>I was able to download and install the updated .udeb by hand in the installer
environment and complete the installation.</p>
<p>This card was installed on a <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon/C220/X10SAE.cfm">Supermicro X10SAE</a> motherboard, and the UEFI BIOS
was able to boot Debian directly from the NVMe card, although I updated to the
latest available BIOS firmware prior to the installation. It appears in <code>lspci</code>

<p>The card itself appears very large in marketing photos, but this is a visual
trick: the photographs are taken with the low-profile PCI bracket installed,
rather than the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Intel_SSD_750_series,_400_GB_add-in_card_model,_top_view.jpg">standard height PCI bracket</a> which it ships installed with.</p>

<p>Simple tests with <code>cat /dev/nvme0n1 &gt;/dev/null</code> and <code>iotop</code> show that the card
can read data at about 1 GB/sec, about twice as fast as the SATA-based SSD that
it replaced. apt/dpkg now run about as fast on the NVMe SSD as they do on a
<code>tmpfs</code>.</p>
<p>Hopefully this device doesn't at some point require updated firmware, like some
<a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9196/samsung-releases-second-840-evo-fix">infamous SSDs have</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.amd.com/en-us/products/graphics/workstation/firepro-3d/4100">AMD FirePro W4100</a> graphics card</h3>
<p>This is a graphics card capable of driving multiple DisplayPort displays at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution#Ultra_HD">"4K" resolution</a> and at a 60 Hz refresh rate. It has four Mini DisplayPort
connectors, although I only use two of them.</p>
<p>It was difficult to find a sensible graphics card. Most discrete graphics cards
<a href="http://femfreq.tumblr.com/image/84553495875">appear to be marketed towards video gamers</a> who apparently must seek out bulky
cards that occupy multiple PCI slots and have excessive cooling devices. (To
take a random example, the <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Graphics-Cards/STRIXR9390XDC3OC8GD5GAMING/">ASUS STRIX R9 390X</a> has three fans and brags about
its "Mega Heatpipes".)</p>
<p>AMD markets a separate line of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_FirePro">"FirePro" graphics cards</a> intended for
professionals rather than gamers, although they appear to be based on the same
GPUs as their "Radeon" video cards. The <a href="http://www.amd.com/en-us/products/graphics/workstation/firepro-3d/4100">AMD FirePro W4100</a> is a normal
half-height PCI-E card that fits into a single PCI slot and has a relatively
small cooler with a single fan. It doesn't even require an auxilliary power
connection and is <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Trident_video_card.png">about the same dimensions</a> as older video cards that I've
successfully used with Debian.</p>
<p>It was difficult to determine whether the W4100 card was actually supported by
an open source driver before buying it. The word "FirePro" appears nowhere on
the webpage for the <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/">X.org Radeon driver</a>, but I was able to find a "CAPE VERDE"
listed as an engineering name which appears to match the "Cape Verde" code name
for the FirePro W4100 given on Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_graphics_processing_units#FirePro_Workstation_Series_.28Wx100.29">List of AMD graphics processing
units</a>. This explains the "verde" string that appears in the firmware filenames
requested by the kernel (available only in the <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/firmware-nonfree">non-free/firmware-amd-graphics
package</a>):</p>

<p>The W4100 appears to work just fine, except for a few bizarre error messages
that are printed to the kernel log when the displays are woken from power saving
mode:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>There don't appear to be any ill effects from these error messages, though. I
have the following package versions installed:</p>
<pre><code class="boxed">||/ Name                          Version             Description

<p>The <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon/C220/X10SAE.cfm">Supermicro X10SAE</a> motherboard has two PCI-E 3.0 slots, but they're listed
as functioning in either "16/NA" or "8/8" mode, which apparently means that
putting anything in the second slot (like the Intel 750 SSD, which uses an x4
link) causes the video card to run at a smaller x8 link width. This can be
verified by looking at the widths reported in the "LnkCap" and "LnkSta" lines in
the <code>lspci -vv</code> output:</p>
<pre><code class="boxed">root@chase{0}:~# lspci -vv -s 01:00.0 | egrep '(LnkCap|LnkSta):'

<p>I did not notice any visible artifacts or performance degradation because of
the smaller link width.</p>
<p>The <code>sensors</code> utility from the <code>lm-sensors</code> package is capable of reporting the
temperature of the GPU:</p>

<h2><a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;sku=210-ADOF">Dell P2715Q</a> monitors</h2>
<p>Two new 27" Dell monitors with a native resolution of 3840x2160 were attached
to the new graphics card. They replaced two ten year old <a href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/monitors/en/spec_2001fp_en.pdf">Dell 2001FP</a> monitors
with a native resolution of 1600x1200 that had experienced burn-in, providing
4.32 times as many pixels. (TV and monitor manufacturers now shamelessly refer
to the 3840x2160 resolution as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution#Ultra_HD">"4K" resolution</a> even though neither dimension
reaches 4000 pixels.)</p>
<p>There was very little to setup beyond plugging the DisplayPort inputs on these
monitors into the DisplayPort outputs on the graphics card. Most of the setup
involved reconfiguring software to work with the very high resolution.</p>
<p>X.org, for tl;dr <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23705">CLOSED NOTABUG</a> reasons doesn't set the DPI correctly. These
monitors have ~163 DPI resolution, so I added <code>-dpi 168</code> to
<code>/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code>. (168 is an even 1.75x multiple of 96.) Software like
Google Chrome and xfce4-terminal rendered fonts and graphical elements at the
right size, but other software like notion, pidgin, and virt-manager did not
fully understand the high DPI. E.g., pidgin renders fonts at the correct size,
but icons are too small.</p>
<p>The default X cursor was also too small. To fix this, I installed the
<a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/dmz-cursor-theme">dmz-cursor-theme package</a>, ran <code>update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme</code>
and selected <code>/usr/share/icons/DMZ-Black/cursor.theme</code> as the cursor theme.</p>
<p>Overall, these displays are much brighter and more readable than the ones they
replaced.</p>
