        <div itemprop="description">ISC recommends compiling BIND with -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks on GCC 4.9.</div>
      </strong>
    </p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>ISC has issued an <a href="https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01167">operational notification</a> advising the use of the
<code>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</code> flag when compiling current versions of BIND
with GCC 4.9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginning with GCC 4.9.0, code optimization in GCC now includes (by default)
an optimization which is intended to eliminate unnecessary null pointer
comparisons in compiled code.  Unfortunately this optimization removes checks
which are necessary in BIND and the demonstrated effect is to cause
unpredictable assertion failures during execution of named, resulting in
termination of the server process.</p>
<p>Future versions of BIND will be modified so that the optimizer does not
incorrectly remove necessary checks when building from source, and until those
versions are available multiple immediate workarounds are available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html">GCC documentation</a>, <code>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</code> performs
the following optimization, and is enabled by default even when compiling with
<code>-O0</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that no code
or data element resides there. This enables simple constant folding
optimizations at all optimization levels. In addition, other optimization
passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow analyses that eliminate
useless checks for null pointers; these assume that if a pointer is checked
after it has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This optimization <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/news/null.html">dates back to 1999</a> but it recently <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/porting_to.html">became more aggressive</a>
in the GCC 4.9 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GCC might now optimize away the null pointer check in code like:</p>
<pre><code>int copy (int* dest, int* src, size_t nbytes) {
  memmove (dest, src, nbytes);
  if (src != NULL)
    return *src;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The pointers passed to <code>memmove</code> (and similar functions in <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>) must
be non-null even when <code>nbytes==0</code>, so GCC can use that information to remove
the check after the <code>memmove</code> call. Calling <code>copy(p, NULL, 0)</code> can therefore
deference a null pointer and crash.</p>
<p>The example above needs to be fixed to avoid the invalid <code>memmove</code> call, for
example:</p>
<pre><code>if (nbytes != 0)
  memmove (dest, src, nbytes);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It's interesting that the ISC operational advisory labels this an "incorrect"
optimization. I wonder if this is a similar case to the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/414467/">Glibc optimization</a>
which exposed incorrect usage of <code>memcpy()</code> in many applications, <a href="https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01085">including
BIND</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, few users should be affected by this bug, since GCC 4.9 is fairly
new. (The upcoming <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/21/ChangeSet#GCC49">Fedora 21 release</a> will probably be the first mainstream
distribution to ship with GCC 4.9 as the default compiler.)</p>
